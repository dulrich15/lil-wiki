my-lil-wiki
===========

My Django based wiki.

- Uses reStructuredText as markup. Chosen for easy extensibility

  - LaTeX for beautiful printing
  - TikZ for beautiful drawing
  - MathJax for beautiful browsing
  - Some Mathplotlib functionality too...
  
- Simple HTML/CSS structure with an eye to mobile
- Unobtrusive full screen editor
- Backend data stored as simple text files --- if you want, use some version control system to capture history
